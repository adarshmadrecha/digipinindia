## About DigiPIN
The Department of Posts has started a new project to build a Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) that will help create a standard and accurate way to identify addresses in India. As part of this project, they have developed something called DIGIPIN – a new digital system for addresses.

DIGIPIN is like a smart, digital version of a postal address. It uses geo-coding, which means it connects a place to its exact location on a map. This makes it much easier to find any home, shop, or office accurately, even in rural or remote areas.

This system is being built with help from IIT Hyderabad, NRSC, and ISRO, and is designed to be open-source, which means anyone can use it freely in their software or services.

DIGIPIN will be very useful for both the government and private companies. It will make it easier to deliver packages, provide emergency help, and offer services like banking, internet, and utilities. It also supports the idea of “Address as a Service (AaaS),” which means that people and businesses will be able to use and share verified address information digitally, just like we use online ID or eKYC today.

Overall, DIGIPIN is a big step towards making India more digital and connected. It will help link real-world places with their online identities, making services faster, smarter, and more efficient for everyone.

## About this project
This project is a simple npm package (compatible with Bun, Node.js, and Deno and also Browser) that provides utilities for working with the DIGIPIN system.
It contains both encoding and decoding functions for DIGIPIN addresses, making it easy to convert between the DIGIPIN format and a lattitude/longitude pair.

## Development
This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) However, there is no reason why it cannot be run with Node.js or Deno.
There is no need to install any additional dependencies.
